Ingredients like niacinamide, clay, or salicylic acid can help regulate sebum production. Avoid heavy creams and over-washing, as it can make oiliness worse.",
      "Managing oily skin involves using non-comedogenic products that won't clog pores. Clay masks once a week can absorb excess oil and detoxify. Look for toners with witch hazel or tea tree oil to help control shine throughout the day. Don't skip moisturizer—hydrated skin can actually reduce oil production."

Use a gentle cleanser and apply different moisturizers or treatments to different areas if needed. Niacinamide and hyaluronic acid are great for addressing both oil and dryness. Avoid harsh ingredients that may irritate either zone.",
      "With combination skin, it’s helpful to multi-mask—use a clay mask on your oily areas and a hydrating mask on dry patches. Stick to gentle, fragrance-free products. A balancing toner and lightweight moisturizer can help maintain overall harmony. Exfoliate once or twice weekly to manage buildup without irritating sensitive zones."

Look for calming ingredients like aloe vera, centella asiatica, and oat extract. Always patch-test new products on a small area before full use.",
      "Managing sensitive skin involves minimizing your skincare routine. Use a mild, fragrance-free cleanser and a soothing moisturizer to keep your skin calm. Avoid hot water and physical exfoliants. Sun protection is also key, so choose a mineral sunscreen with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide."

A good night cream and regular use of sunscreen are essential to slow aging. Healthy habits like proper sleep and hydration also make a big difference.",
      "An anti-aging routine should include retinoids, vitamin C, and hyaluronic acid to keep the skin firm, bright, and moisturized. Don't underestimate the power of sunscreen—it's the most effective anti-aging product. Apply it daily even indoors. Consistency and patience are crucial for long-term results."

Start with once or twice a week to avoid over-exfoliation. Always follow with moisturizer and sunscreen, as your skin will be more sensitive.",
      "Proper exfoliation improves product absorption and unclogs pores. Choose exfoliants based on your skin type—lactic acid for dry skin, salicylic acid for oily or acne-prone skin. Avoid scrubbing too harshly, especially if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin. Remember to moisturize afterward to protect your skin barrier."

Look for ingredients like ceramides, glycerin, or hyaluronic acid. Apply moisturizer right after cleansing while your skin is still damp.",
      "Hydrated skin looks plumper and feels more comfortable throughout the day. If your skin feels tight, flaky, or itchy, it's likely dehydrated. Use richer creams at night and lighter gels in the morning. Avoid alcohol-heavy products that can dry out your skin over time."

Start using it 2–3 nights a week, and gradually increase as your skin builds tolerance. Always wear SPF during the day when using retinol.",
      "Retinol can be transformative but also drying, so pair it with a good moisturizer. Avoid using it with exfoliants or vitamin C in the same routine to prevent irritation. Introduce it slowly, and use only at night. If you have sensitive skin, consider starting with a retinol alternative like bakuchiol."

This method ensures your skin is thoroughly clean without stripping its natural oils. It's especially useful at night or if you wear heavy products.",
      "The oil-based cleanser helps break down waterproof products and pollutants, while the second cleanser tackles leftover debris. It’s gentle and effective for all skin types when done right. Choose a mild second cleanser suited to your skin type to avoid over-drying."

      "A good toner can help restore your skin’s pH and add a boost of hydration. Look for ingredients like rose water, chamomile, or hyaluronic acid. Avoid harsh astringents unless your skin is very oily. Use it twice daily after cleansing and before serums or moisturizers."
